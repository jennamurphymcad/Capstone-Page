      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

      <p>The Coronavirus has brought the physical art world to a halt.<sup>1</sup> Since the onset of COVID-19, 92% of Minnesota Art Organizations have reported canceled events, with an estimated loss of 2,351 ,612 attendees. Americans for the Arts has found that out of those Minnesota organization, 11% are not confident their organizations will survive the impact of COVID-19.<sup>2</sup></p>

      <p>In response to the changing time, many organizations are quickly increasing their online presence and making artwork more accessible through digital means than ever before. The rise of online viewing rooms and virtual tours are becoming more and more common, from large and small organizations alike.<sup>3</sup></p>

      <p>Despite this, there will always be a desire for collectors and art viewers to have an in-person experience and to be able to physically interact with works of art. The transition from Coronavirus to a new normal will likely reveal a new hybrid exhibition approach of physical and digital in the future.<sup>4</sup> For artists delving into New Media Art, this presents a special opportunity to expand their influence and enhance viewers understanding of their work and process.</p>

      <p>The aim of my capstone project is to show how digital exhibition companion pieces can increase engagement and accessibility, specifically in regards to New Media artists' work, in times of social distancing and beyond, creating tools that can be used both online and in the exhibition space to engage the viewers and enhance the understanding of their work.</p>
